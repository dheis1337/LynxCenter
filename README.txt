Lynx Center Survey Project

Take a look at a few of the scripts I wrote. 
The LynxCenterSurveyClean script are a set of functions that clean the survey data sets.
The LynxCenterSurveyLargeDF script takes all of the data sets and cleans
them according to the functions in LynxCenterSurveyClean. The final 
result is the CleanSurvey.csv file. 

The LynxCenterSurveyAnalysis is some basic analysis of the CleanSurvey.csv 
data set. The analysis is still a work in project!
